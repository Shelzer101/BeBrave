                    <p>
                        You go over to your bestfriend's house expecting to do homework and play videogames 
                        or watch movies. Instead, when you enter her room she turns 
                        around with tears running down her face and says "I don't know what to do.." .
                        She then goes on to explain that she has been bullied for the past month by her own 
                        friends from school. She has been called mean names, they wouldn't invite her to their 
                        houses anymore, and they would spread fake rumors about her in school. She looks at 
                        me with tears still in her eyes and says, "What do I do?".
